This section will talk about Bridge Network on Docker world.
from here there will be an SQL Query for Creating my db Tables.

**from now on there will be only commands**

docker network ls
# I'll see the previos networks that i created in the previos sections

docker networks prune
# Delete the previos networks

docker run --rm my-webserver -d httpd
# I'll run my docker and create a web server that uses httpd image and it recieves an ID

docker inspect my-webserver
# I'll see the IP Address that the webserver recieved

docker run --rm <mygitaccount>:mycurl my-webserver
# I'll enTer the curl into my repo, in the first time it'll not succeceeded but if i'll add the IP Address hat i got, it will work

docker network create simple-network
# Now i creating a simple network where we can connect our containers on

docker network ls
# Now ill see that i created a network

docker run --rm -d --name my-webserver --network simple-network httpd
# now i'll run my container with the name my-webserver with the simple-network that i crrated with httpd image

docker run --rm -- network simple-network <mygitaccount>/mycurl webserver
# Now i'll enter this container to my repo with the network + i added the correct curl

docker inspect my-webserver
# and now it will be fixed the problem before
