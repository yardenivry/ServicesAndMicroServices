from here there will be an SQL Query for Creating my db Tables.

**from now on there will be onl commands**

USE somedatabase;

# Create a new database confs

SHOW Tables;

# Dont appear yet nothing because i just created a db but not db table 

CREATE TABLE mytable (id INT);

SHOW Tables;

# Now the db table was added.
