from here there will be an SQL Query for Creating my db Tables.

**from now on there will be onl commands**

USE somedatabase;

# Create a new database confs

SHOW Tables;

# Dont appear yet nothing because i just created a db but not db table 

CREATE TABLE mytable (id INT);

SHOW Tables;

# Now the db table was added.

# After this action the volume will be deleted, if i want to save that i'll reconfigure the Docker-copose file and add the line: 
volumes:
  - ./data:/var/www/html
# I wrote t my "data" folder the data from /var/www/html
